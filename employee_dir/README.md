## General Info

This project is a simple quiz! It showcases use of bootstrap, local storage, loops and if else statements. The user has 75 seconds to finish answering five questions. If the user answers wrong, their score is subtracted by 5 points, if they answer correctly, they score 10 points. At the end of the quiz, users will add their initials with their score and it will be stored in local storage and then posted to the high score leaderboard.

## Instructions

The user MUST have a dot env file to use the spotify portion of this app. First the user must open the file in terminal and then run the program "node liri.js" and then one of the four set of commands. Liri is meant to be told a command of "concert-this", "spotify-this-song", "movie-this", or "do-what-it-says" and it will then give you the corresponding data of that inquiry. Be sure to put your song/movie/artist in quotes, otherwise it will not work (ie. "node liri.js movie-this "the goonies"). The last command do-what-it-says runs what is in the random.txt file, so if the user wants a different song from "I Want It That Way", they must go into that file and change it to the desired song.
